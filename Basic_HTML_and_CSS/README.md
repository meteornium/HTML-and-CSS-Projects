# HTML and CSS Projects

This is a display of sample websites I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects

* [Unova Getaway Site](https://github.com/meteornium/HTML-and-CSS-Projects-TTA/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/UNOVA%20GETAWAY)
* [Bookstore Site](https://github.com/meteornium/HTML-and-CSS-Projects-TTA/tree/main/Basic_HTML_and_CSS/BOOKSTORE)

#### Unova Getaway Site

This page is an example of a single home page for a Unova region getaway. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.

###Bookstore Site

This page is an example of a home page of a bookstore that is styled using Bootstrap 5. It contains many Bootstrap componenets, including but not limited to a navbar, form, cards, and dropdowns.
